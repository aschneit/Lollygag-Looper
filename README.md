# Lollygag-Looper

# Background & MVP

Lollygag Looper is an audio looping app that allows the user to click buttons and create overlapping loops from a variety of synthesized sound sources. The user is able to adjust the tempo of the underlying loop and change the timbre and pitch of the sound sources. There is also a visual element that is triggered when each sound source is initiated or repeated.

The project will also include a production README.

# Technologies

The project will use JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and possibly a Web Audio framework such as Tone.js.
